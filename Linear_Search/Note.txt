--> Linear Search Algorithm

Welcome to your first Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) code! Today, we're diving into the world of linear search, a fundamental algorithm used to find a target value within a list or array.

--> What is Linear Search?

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple method for finding a target value within a collection of items. It works by sequentially checking each element in the list until the target element is found or until all elements have been checked.

--> How Does it Work?

Start at the beginning of the list.
Compare the target value with each element of the list sequentially.
If the target value matches an element, return the index of that element.
If the target value is not found after checking all elements, return a "not found" indication.

--> Example:

Let's say we have an array [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42] and we want to find the index of the value 15.

Start at the beginning:
Compare 4 with 15 (no match).
Compare 8 with 15 (no match).
Compare 15 with 15 (match found!).
Return the index of 15, which is 2.

--> Pseudocode:

function linearSearch(array, target):
    for each element in the array:
        if element equals target:
            return index of element
    return "not found"

--> Conclusion:

Linear search is a simple yet effective algorithm for finding elements within a list. While it may not be the most efficient for large datasets, it's a great starting point for understanding basic search algorithms in DSA.

Happy coding!
